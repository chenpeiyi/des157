                <h2>The Old Testament</h2>
                <p>When: September – October, 2015</p>
                <p>Why: Seeking. Started to be curious about Christianity. Got the my first ever devotional book just for emotional comfort.</p>
                <p>Highlight Verse: Isaiah 57:16 For I will not contend forever, nor will I always be angry; for the spirit would grow faint before me, and the breath of life that I made.</p>
                <p>Thoughts/Stage: Bible verses were interested to read, but apparently I wasn’t honest or serious about it. I thought all I had to do was to “make God happy” by doing good deeds then God will bless me.</p>

                <h2>Book of Matthew</h2>
                <p>When: January – Feburary 2016</p>
                <p>Why: Seeking more. Saw my sinfulness at Winter Retreat and decided to investigate more in Christianity.</p>
                <p>Highlight Verse: Matthew 9: 2-3 2 And behold, some people brought to him a paralytic, lying on a bed. And when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, “Take heart, my son; your sins are forgiven.” 3 And behold, some of the scribes said to themselves, “This man is blaspheming.”</p>
                <p>Thoughts: First time ever I felt like God was speaking to me. Tbh it was scary! I was able to identify myself with the paralytic and I need my friends’ help to deal with my “paralysis.” Because of God’s powerful word, I took my first step of faith even though I was not a Christian: I broke my newly signed lease and decided to move to a place closer to where my friends and leaders lived.</p>

                <h2>Portraits of God</h2>
                <p>When: April – May 2016</p>
                <p>Why: Became Christian a week after Easter, April 3rd! Devotionals became more regular and serious.</p>
                <p>Highlight Verse: Genesis 3: 9 But the Lord God called to the man and said to him, “Where are you?”</p>
                <p>Thoughts: Above was God’s response to the first human sin – Adam eating the apple and hid. God was not angry or wrathful, saying: “You come out! Told you not to eat the apple!” No no no. He was gentle and wanted to draw closer to man, so that they could reason together.</p>

                <h2>The Letters – Epistles</h2>
                <p>When: August – October 2016</p>
                <p>Why: Summer time! But never stop listening to God’s word daily. </p>
                <p>Highlight verse: Philippians 3:9 and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God that depends on faith… </p>
                <p>Thoughts: Challenged by the godly qualities proposed by the apostles. Was thankful for the cross daily because I was not perfect but Jesus died for me to make me pure before God. Realized that salvation is not by work or by law (inheritance, etc), but only by faith in Jesus. </p>

                <h2>2 Corinthians</h2>
                <p>When: December 2016</p>
                <p>Why: Became student leader. Daily devotions became a must-do even during winter break. It was hard though! Easy to get lazy at home…</p>
                <p>Highlight verse: 2 Corinthians 8:9 For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor, so that you through His poverty might become rich. </p>
                <p>Thoughts: The book was very hard to read without context and I even grew frustrated at it sometimes. Paul sounded like crazy as he wrote to the Corinthians, but I also saw how much my spiritual leaders loved me like “crazy” just like Paul loved the Corinthians. Who knew during this period of time I was actually running away from God by refusing to build a relationship with him. </p>

                <h2>The Book of John</h2>
                <p>When: January – Feburary 2016</p>
                <p>Why: Daily devotions is still a must-do. </p>
                <p>Highlight verse: 3 Jesus answered him, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again[a] he cannot see the kingdom of God.” 4 Nicodemus said to him, “How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born?” </p>
                <p>Thoughts: After Winter Retreat, I realized how much I did not want to be “born again” like Nicodemus because I was holding on to my outward image by trying to be a better person. Deep down I did not have a relationship with God because I refused to confess to him how dark my heart was. Started to draw closer to God by repenting and experiencing forgiveness. </p>
