        "What about driving down the road at sixty-five miles per hour, only a few feet away from cars going the opposite direction at the same speed? Someone would only have to jerk his or her arm and you would be dead. <em>I don't think that't morbid; I think it's reality.</em>

        Frederick Buechner writes, "'Intelectually we all know that we will die, but we do not really know it in the sense that th knowledge becomes a part of us. We do not really know it in the sense of living as through it were true. On the contrary, we tend to live as though our lives would go on forever.'" - Francis Chan

          "Stan was giving a eulogy at a memorial service when he decided to share the gospel. At the end of his message, Stan told the mourners, "You never know when God is going to take your life. At that moment, there's nothing you can do about it. <em>Are you ready?</em>" Then Stan sat down, fell over, and died. His wife and sons tried to resuscitate him, but there was nothing they could do-just as Stan had said a few minutes earlier." - Francis Chen

          "Brooke Bronkowski was a beautiful fourteen-year-girl who was in love with Jesus. When she was in junior high, she started a Bible study on her campus. She spent her babysitting money on Bibles so she could give them out to her unsaved friends. Youth pastors who heard about this brought her boxes of Bibles to give away.
          [...]
          During her freshman year in high school, Brooke was in a car accident while driving to the movies. <em>Her life on earth ended when she was just fourteen, but her impact didn't.</em> Nearly fifteen hundred people attended Brooke's memorial service. People from her public high school read poems she had written about her love for God. Everyone spoke of her example and her joy." - Francis Chen

          "Sadly, many people die while living selfishly. Their funerals are filled by individuals who stretch the truth in order to create a semblance of aÂ meaningful life. Nobody would dare say an unkind word at the funeral; there is an unspoken obligation to come up with something nice to say about the person who died. But sometimes we secretly think the same thing: He really wasn't that great of a person." - Francis Chen
