                <p>Typeform is an interactive web form created for "humans", as they advertised. It has a great sense of clarity. As the user enters the form, the cursor is automatically placed on the input field. It straightforwardly tells the user the
                purpose of the website. As the user enters information, the "Ok" button below it turns from greyed-out to solid green color, signifying that it is clickable and telling the user they can keep going. Next to the "Ok" button, it says
                "press Enter." With the keyboard shortcut, makes it easier and faster to go onto the next item. </p>
                <p>After hitting Enter, the transition is smooth between question to question. The previous question fades out and the current question becomes clear. It serves its purpose of obtaining information from the user, and also surprises the user that entering information can be fun and interactive.</p>

                <h3>User Interface: Canvas</h3>

                    Canvas is a online learning system that is widely used by UC Davis students, including me. I enjoy using a simple and effective learning system like Canvas, that minimizes my complaints during the stressful quarter system.

                <p>
                    When first enter canvas, one is attracted by the colorful blocks that represent individual courses. Instead of a plain, text-only, list view of courses, the color blocks gives more breathing space and a playful environment. One can easily find and click
                    on the course wanted. The aside bar on the right has details about homework assignments, which is a good reminder to students who don't know what they need to do. The to-do list intergrates light blue text color and icons, making the
                    tasks look less intimidating. The typeface for the site is a san serif typeface that is not default for the browser. It shows that the website is well-crafted and gives the viewer a fresh impression.
