                  Inspired by Francis Chan's book Crazy Love, I decided to make an interface that include abstract elements that tell people about how short life is - you might not even finish messing around this interface because you don't know what will happen to you next second!
                </p>
                <p>
                  The color scheme is bold and catches attention. Though death is a serious topic, the colors give a relaxing and intriguing feeling and attracts the user to interact with it.
                </p>

                <p>
                  When website is first loaded, there is a fade in effect. The dashed line elements come in slowly from the top. As the user hover over the dashed line elements, the cursor changes to a pointer prompting the user to click. The grey dashed line encourages the user to hover and makes them curious about the elements.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The interface also includes animation. If the user clicks on the car, the car is going to move. If they click on the house, the roof is going to fly up. These animations engage the user more in the story that is told.

                <h3>Pocket Full of Interface</h3>

                    I wanted to make an interface to record my spiritual journey. Devotional books play a big part in my spiritual growth, so I decided to introduce each devotional books and how certain Bible verses spoke to me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I used a timeline to put things in chronological order. It is straightforward to put my elements in order. The user can click the squares to view the description of each book and my thoughts on it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the user hovers over the square, it has a quick but smooth brighten effect. This way, the user knows that they are on a clickable area.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, I use geometric shape to add abstraction and a mysterious feel. The user might be curious about what these empty squares are about, and they can find out by clicking it.

                <p>Typeform is an interactive web form created for "humans", as they advertised. It has a great sense of clarity. As the user enters the form, the cursor is automatically placed on the input field. It straightforwardly tells the user the
                    purpose of the website. As the user enters information, the "Ok" button below it turns from greyed-out to solid green color, signifying that it is clickable and telling the user they can keep going. Next to the "Ok" button, it says
                    "press Enter." With the keyboard shortcut, makes it easier and faster to go onto the next item. </p>
                <p>After hitting Enter, the transition is smooth between question to question. The previous question fades out and the current question becomes clear. It serves its purpose of obtaining information from the user, and also surprises the user
                    that entering information can be fun and interactive.</p>

                <h3>User Interface: Canvas</h3>

                    Canvas is a online learning system that is widely used by UC Davis students, including me. I enjoy using a simple and effective learning system like Canvas, that minimizes my complaints during the stressful quarter system.
                </p>
                <figure>
                    <a href="images/canvas2.png"><img src="images/canvas2.png" alt="canvas screenshot 2"></a>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    When first enter canvas, one is attracted by the colorful blocks that represent individual courses. Instead of a plain, text-only, list view of courses, the color blocks gives more breathing space and a playful environment. One can easily find and click
                    on the course wanted. The aside bar on the right has details about homework assignments, which is a good reminder to students who don't know what they need to do. The to-do list intergrates light blue text color and icons, making the
                    tasks look less intimidating. The typeface for the site is a san serif typeface that is not default for the browser. It shows that the website is well-crafted and gives the viewer a fresh impression.
