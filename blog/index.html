            Canvas is a online learning system that is widely used by UC Davis students, including me. I enjoy using a simple and effective learning system like Canvas, that minimizes my complaints during the stressful quarter system.

            When first enter canvas, one is attracted by the colorful blocks that represent individual courses. Instead of a plain, text-only, list view of courses, the color blocks gives more breathing space and a playful environment. One can easily find and click
            on the course wanted. The aside bar on the right has details about homework assignments, which is a good reminder to students who don't know what they need to do. The to-do list intergrates light blue text color and icons, making the tasks
            look less intimidating. The typeface for the site is a san serif typeface that is not default for the browser. It shows that the website is well-crafted and gives the viewer a fresh impression.
