        In the first storyboard, I drew the scenario where two acquaintances had a good conversation and got to know each other more. Person A was encouraged and posted about their conversation on the ShareGood app after getting Person B's permission. Person A chose to share with her peers and got a fruit for her Fruitfulness tree. Her sharing encouraged people who'd viewed the conversation.

        For the second storyboard, I added the catergory of "prayer request," so that the kind of sharing is not limited to encouraging things, but also concerning, urgent matters. People who's seen the prayer requests can pray for the person requested.
