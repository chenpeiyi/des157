        I am really thankful that Glenda was able to invite live audiences to class to test out our prototype! We had three people use our product, and most of them liked the idea of sharing kindness and said it was easy to navigate. Two of the testers suggested to add an anonymous option, where user can add the post anonymously. We got some mixed opinion on the design, where some liked the minimalist look and some suggested to add more color. Other features suggested include: posting pictures, adding Facebook and Twitter sign-in, adding emojis, adding interactive elements. David suggested to eliminate the menu page and have the user to straight to the “All Post”, which I think it’s a good idea since the user only sees the menu one time and then they will have the nav bar in the bottom. I would definitely work on the visual design and interactive element to make it look more professional and presentable.
