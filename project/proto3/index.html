        <h2>Food and friends</h2>
        <h3>Amy Ye</h3>
        <p>
          Winter quarter has been a tough time. For a while I was really stressed about school and working two jobs, which made me very lonely as well. But, one of my classmates invited me over for dinner. She cooked a delicious meal of chicken and rice. It really touched me that she wanted to hang out with me and took the time out to do something nice for me when I was feeling down.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I have the chance, I would love to invite her over to my place to hangout and eat. But it sucks that I'm not as good of a chef as her.

        <h2>Care Packages</h2>
        <h3>Peiyi Chen</h3>
        <p>
          My friends could see that school and extra curricular activities were weighing down on me. In fact, I had been in a sour mood due to illness as well. So, three of my friends came over with care packages, which was just what I needed going into this finals season.
        </p>
        <p>
          To pass it on, I will give my other friends care packages when they are in need. To my friends who treated me well, I will treat them out for a well deserved meal!
