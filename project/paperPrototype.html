        I did both prototypes in 10 minutes and had someone in class tested them out. I like how we had time constraint so I did not need to wate a lot of time thinking about what to put. My classmates gave me helpful feedback. I could improve it by: adding a back button and a menu bar to make the navigation easier, improving terminology, adding a SAVE and SUBMIT button so the user can make an action after they finished typing.
