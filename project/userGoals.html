        <h2>How will your users understand the content of the project?</h2>

        <p>An introduction will be included in the app, illustrating what are the different sections in the app, what the app does, and how to use it. There will be a navigation bar either in the bottom or on the side to guide the user. </p>

        <h2>How will your users understand the primary objectives?</h2>
        <p>The users will understand it through the motto – “Share encouraging moments with those who you care.” The sharing section will be similar to that of common social media apps. We will use a CTA button for “compose” – similar to gmail app – to prompt
            the user to compose content and share.</p>

        <h2>What content and features do your users need, and in what form do they need it?</h2>
        <p>The users need the sharing section, sharing setting (to certain audience), tips on communications, and reward for sharing/act out kindness/endorsing other. Sections will be displayed in a minimal, straightforward form arranged horizontally. </p>

        <h2>How do your users think your interactive projects should work and what are 
their experience levels with the type of media you are creating?</h2>
        <p>Users will experiment by clicking on different buttons. Users are proficient in using smartphones and are accustomed to what most social media apps look like. </p>
