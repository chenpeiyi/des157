        <p>Forest app: https://www.forestapp.cc/en/

        <p>The intention of Forest is similar to one of my topic interest: let people leave their phone alone. According to the authors, they realized the problem in excessive use of smart phone, which results in decline in productivity and distance in relationships.
        </p>
        <p>According to their website, when you want to do work and leave your phone, open the app and plant a tree. If the app is closed, then the tree would die. The motivation for users is to build a forest. The tag line says: "The harder you work, the
            lusher your forest is."</p>
        <p>The authors put thoughts into interaction and interface design. They chose tree as the main object, instead of some cute animal. The reason, they say, is that animals might distract people with their cuteness, while tree gives a peaceful and simple
            feel. Using tree planting matches with their goal of avoid user from being distracted. </p>
        <p>The main interface is simple and straight-forward. It includes a sentence summarizing the amount of time focused today, a tree image, time ellapsed, and the "plant" button. There is also another interface that shows statistics in a colorful pie
            chart.
        </p>
        <p>I like the simple and effective design in this app. It increases productivity but does not motivate people much to have a conversation with others while they are not on their phone. That's something I can think about adding on. </p>

        <h2 class="blog-h2">Perspective Cards</h2>
        <p>
            Perspective cards app: http://www.perspectivecards.com/apps/

        <p>Perspective cards are a deck of card that trigger spiritual conversation between people. The app includes all the cards and allow people to choose cards that matches their perspective on spiritual topics: "Nature of God, Human Nature, Meaning
            of Life, Identity of Jesus, and Source of Spiritual Truth." The style of the visual design is unique and colorful, but not distracting. One of the header fonts is handwritten and playful, which engagingly shows the user that spiritual topics
            can be interesting. </p>

        <p>This app brings two or more people together to have a spiritual conversation in a short moment. It matches with my interest of sparking conversation between family members. In my project, there might be less textured background or handdrawn images
            because of time constraint. I could borrow the idea of grouping conversation starter questions into topics. To engage the user, I can also use bold colors. </p>
